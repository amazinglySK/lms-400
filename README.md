# ðŸ“š LMS - 400

Reminds you of a submarine/sea vessel? Exactly what I thought of too!

## Project Details 

This project was created for the CBSE final project, integrating python concepts with mysql. LMS stands for "Library Management System". It is a simple app to manage books through a GUI made using PyQt5 with it's backend in a local mysql database.

The project colorscheme was generated using [realtime-colors](https://realtimecolors.com/?colors=0a050f-faf7fd-59248f-deceef-7305e1).

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. MYSQL 8.x
3. [xlsxwriter module](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/)
3. [Python mysql-connector library](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/)
